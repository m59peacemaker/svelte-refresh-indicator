When going from the manual mode to the spinner, the tail of the spinner should collapse toward the head of the spinner. I adjusted the rotation of the spinner to match the arrow, but what happens is the head of the spinner starts out in the same place as the head of the arrow, but the rest of the spinner is not visible whereas the arrow had a long body, so it looks like it abruptly disappeared.
